/// @page mysql_driver MySQL Driver - EXPERIMENTAL
///
/// Disclaimer: current state of the driver is highly experimental, and
/// although APIs are not likely to change drastically, some adjustments may be
/// made in the future.
/// Please also keep in mind that this driver is a community-based effort and is
/// not backed by Yandex expertise nor by Yandex-scale production usage.
///
/// üêô **userver** provides access to MySQL databases servers via
/// components::MySQL. The uMySQL driver is asynchronous, and with it one can
/// write queries like this:
/// @snippet storages/tests/unittests/showcase_mysqltest.cpp  uMySQL usage sample - main page
/// No macros, no meta-structs, no boilerplate, just your types used directly. <br>
/// Interested? - read ahead.
///
/// @section features Features
/// - Connection pooling;
/// - Binary protocol (prepared statements);
/// - Transactions;
/// - Read-only cursors;
/// - Batch Inserts/Updates (requires MariaDB 10.2+);
/// - Variadic template statements parameters passing;
/// - Statement result extraction into C++ types;
/// - Mapping C++ types to native MySQL types;
/// - Userver-specific types: Decimal64, Json;
/// - Nullable for all supported types (via std::optional<T>);
/// - Type safety validation for results extraction, signed vs unsigned
/// validation, nullable vs not-nullable validation;
/// - Seamless integration with userver infrastructure: configuring, logging,
/// metrics etc.;
///
/// @section info More information
/// - For configuring see components::MySQL
