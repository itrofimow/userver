## The list of TODOs for uMySQL driver. 
For my personal use mostly, in no particular order

* Transaction interface, and how to make it ~identical to that of Cluster without much copy-paste (4h)
* Topology (master-slave, multi-master etc.) (~10h)
* TLS (3h, think about file access if any)
* Better unit-tests with clear separation of what is tested (8h)
* Fault-tolerance tests (ages)
* CI for MySQL 5.7, MySQL 8.0+ and MariaDB (+ the same for testsuite) (6h)
* Logging, metrics (6h)

Damn
